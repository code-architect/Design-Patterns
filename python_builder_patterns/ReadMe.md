#Builder Pattern
<p> 
Some objects are simple and can be created in a single initializer call, but sometimes other objects require a lot of 
ceremony to create, i.e. we have to build up the object in stages. But having an object with 10 or 20 different 
initializer is not productive. Instead opt for piecewise construction.
